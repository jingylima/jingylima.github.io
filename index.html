        <h1><strong>Jing Yi Lim</strong></h1>
        I'm building something exciting.<br><br>

        I build production-grade trading systems at a top-tier quantitative hedge fund that I can't say much about.
        Things I can talk about: I enjoy hacking up things related to statistical modeling (and winning hackathons!). As
        an avid game builder (e.g. multiplayer asymmetric strategy games), I also
        research vision and graphics (Gaussian Splats, diffusion models, 3D asset generation) and think about how to
        bring gaming to the next level. I believe hyper-personalization of games will happen in the next five years,
        from NPCs to storylines to game
        worlds.<br><br>

        Before that, I graduated from UC Berkeley. During my undergrad I led the math and coding club and maybe spent a
        little too much time on speech/debate competitions.

            <h2><strong>Additional Experience</strong></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Researcher at Barsky Lab, UC Berkeley
                    <br>
                    <em>Worked on the Vision Correcting Display, which tracks the user's eyes and distorts images in
                        real time, allowing users with visual abberations to see normally. Implemented fast and accurate
                        pupil detection using algorithms such as Haar Cascades, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, Linear
                        Support Vector Machine.</em>

                <li>
                    Researcher at Margolis Lab, UCSF
                    <br>
                    <em>Worked on a library of parallelized statistical analysis algorithms and neural
                        networks to
                        determine the biophysical
                        properties of neurons based on their electrophysiological response to dopaminergic compounds, as
                        well as the detection of duplicate or overlapping units. </em>

            <h2><strong>Hackathons</strong></h2><br>
            I think hackathons are great. Artificial crunch time, a low-stakes yet high-pressure environment that
            manages to <i>feel</i> high-stakes. Every hackathon, I make sure to incorporate several components that used
            to be completely new to me - I only have 24 or so hours to become an expert and build something great.
